*** CURRENTLY ***

note:

  chips threads used threadInfo/syntax=sl or py to indicate langauge support
  (from a quick hack in beta 2 that Liz used)

*) URLs in PDFs

Check whether URLs printed out in the hardcopy versions of pages -
in particular ahelp indexes - are correct. This is the URL value at the top
of the page giving the location of the page being viewed.

*) links.xsl and /<site>/ links

There are links to /ciao/ (and sherpa/chips) which probably need to
allow for the fact we may want them to go to /ciaobeta/ etc.

Should they include the "version" value from the config.dat file for
that site? The problem comes when you want to link to the latest version 
of that page and not a particular version (as is most oftern the case apart
from this beta release).

*) download links

should probably move the download link name into the config file file
rather than update the links.xsl (and other?) pages at each release.
Actually, they do not hardcode the version; the problem here is that
we have the string _ciao4b2_ (or b3) that is hardcoded.

*) DOM manipulation rather than stylesheets/manual code

Convert publish.pl to use the DOM rather than stylesheets to extract
simple information from files. Done for many simple cases. There are
still 
  list.xsl, list_<x>.xsl for
    <x> = faq, dictionary

mk_ahelp_setup.pl uses DOM to parse the ahelp files but then stores
the information in a set of perl structures which it then uses to 
manually create an XML output file. We should look at creating a
DOM which can then be written out directly. Also, remove the use of
the ahelpindex.dat file in the mk_ahelp_*.pl files.

This is ongoing work.

*) thread_common.xsl can probably be refactrored in places
   as can the threadlink-* templates in links.xsl

*) Clean up config.dat file/location

Think about changing the config.dat file so that it lives
at the "top" of the doc tree for a set of web pages - 

e.g. /data/da/Docs/ciaoweb/ciao34/config.dat

- which would mean being able to remove site and version
sections (although would want to have these variables set).

*) thread index a la ahelp index

Perhaps we should treat the threads in a similar manner to 
ahelp pages and create a single file containing the information
we need to create the thread indexes/threadlink tags?

*) move some checks into the config file/publish.pl?

The allowed-pdf/sites/download-types checks done by the stylesheet
could perhaps be done by giving the list of values in the config
file and then checking against these in publish.pl.

*) add a tag to info section to indicate no hardcopy output

*) use XInclude rather than the home grown include code (eg in threads)?

*) make the page handling code respect the info/proglang setting

One issue here is whether this means all uses of cxclink - and other
links as we increase the support for this - need to support

  - no /*/info/proglang -> simple link
  - $proglang unset -> link to both versions
  - $proglang set   -> link to the language-specific version

behavior?
