updating links.xsl to allow linking between sites for ahelp tags

*) ahelp tables

The crates ahelp files have tables with empty columns; these are not displayed in
ahelp and so should not be in the HTML output either.

*) links.xsl and /<site>/ links

There are links to /ciao/ (and sherpa/chips) which probably need to
allow for the fact we may want them to go to /ciaobeta/ etc.

Should they include the "version" value from the config.dat file for
that site? The problem comes when you want to link to the latest version 
of that page and not a particular version (as is most oftern the case apart
from this beta release).

*) download links

should probably move the download link name into the config file file
rather than update the links.xsl (and other?) pages at each release.
