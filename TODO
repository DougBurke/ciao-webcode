*) URLs in PDFs

Check whether URLs printed out in the hardcopy versions of pages -
in particular ahelp indexes - are correct. This is the URL value at the top
of the page giving the location of the page being viewed.

*) links.xsl and /<site>/ links

There are links to /ciao/ (and sherpa/chips) which probably need to
allow for the fact we may want them to go to /ciaobeta/ etc.

Should they include the "version" value from the config.dat file for
that site? The problem comes when you want to link to the latest version 
of that page and not a particular version (as is most oftern the case apart
from this beta release).

*) download links

should probably move the download link name into the config file file
rather than update the links.xsl (and other?) pages at each release.
Actually, they do not hardcode the version; the problem here is that
we have the string _ciao4b2_ (or b3) that is hardcoded.
