*) URLs in PDFs

Check whether URLs printed out in the hardcopy versions of pages -
in particular ahelp indexes - are correct. This is the URL value at the top
of the page giving the location of the page being viewed.

*) links.xsl and /<site>/ links

There are links to /ciao/ (and sherpa/chips) which probably need to
allow for the fact we may want them to go to /ciaobeta/ etc.

Should they include the "version" value from the config.dat file for
that site? The problem comes when you want to link to the latest version 
of that page and not a particular version (as is most oftern the case apart
from this beta release).

*) download links

should probably move the download link name into the config file file
rather than update the links.xsl (and other?) pages at each release.
Actually, they do not hardcode the version; the problem here is that
we have the string _ciao4b2_ (or b3) that is hardcoded.

*) DOM manipulation rather than stylesheets/manual code

Convert publish.pl to use the DOM rather than stylesheets to extract
simple information from files. Done for many simple cases. There are
still 
  list.xsl, list_<x>.xsl for
    <x> = faq, thread, threadindex, dictionary

mk_ahelp_setup.pl uses DOM to parse the ahelp files but then stores
the information in a set of perl structures which it then uses to 
manually create an XML output file. We should look at creating a
DOM which can then be written out directly. Also, remove the use of
the ahelpindex.dat file in the mk_ahelp_*.pl files.
